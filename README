This is a twitter roast bot made fully in python made by me!
To run the code on your own computer you need to first apply to get a
twitter developer account and get twitter API 2.0 keys. You also need to make
a project that links to you twitter account so you can make posts. You can
see how to apply below. 
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access

Then you need to download or pull this GitHub repository. After downloading,
you need to input your Twitter consumer key and secret, access token and secret,
and lastly your bearer token. Then in the toroast.txt input the names of the 
accounts you would like to roast. Then you just need to run the main.py files 
and the twitter bot will roast the users specified.

Thanks and enjoy!
